# VIX-ID-X-Partnerts-Final-Project

Final Project : Credit Risk Modelling

This Virtual Intership Experience was held by collaborative program between ID/X Partner and Rakamin Academy.

Elaboration:
Collaborated with various other departments on this project to provide technology solutions for the company. I was asked to build a model that can predict credit risk using a dataset provided by the company which consists of data on loans received and those that were rejected. 

Note: end-to-end solution.
